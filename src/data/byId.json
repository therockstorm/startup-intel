A Stanford graduate with a master’s degree in engineering and a professional background in venture capital, Adams never expected to be the founder of a mental healthcare startup. His own experience dealing with depression in therapy, however, led him to launch New York City-based Headway in 2017 as a matching tool for patients and therapists. After working on it a year and a half, Adams realized the greater problem was that so many people simply couldn’t afford professional help. Many therapists (Headway claims 70%, based on its own 2018 survey) don’t take insurance. To up that number, Headway built software that handles billing and administrative support. Patients then have access to a free directory of therapists they can actually afford. The company says that three quarters of the therapists who signed on in New York City, its first market, did not previously take insurance. Headway makes its money by getting a cut of the insurer’s reimbursement. \"Therapists get to say yes to people they would typically have to say no to, patients are able to spend $20 instead of $200 for a session and insurance companies are actually saving money with more people seeing therapists,\" says Adams.",

The problem was that connectivity wasn't keeping up with advances in artificial intelligence and machine learning. \"That was the aha moment for us,\" says Gajendra, 48. \"This AI and machine learning train is heading really fast.\" So in 2017, they quit their jobs to start Santa Clara, California-based Astera to create connectivity solutions that could help keep data flowing. It designs its chips on the cloud, speeding up that process, and has them fabricated by TSMC. To get Amazon's AWS as an early customer, the founders went to their contacts and told them why they'd need such a solution to data-center bottlenecks. \"I don't know how convinced they were, but in the past we had done a good job on execution,\" says Mohan, 49. \"When they got convinced was when we delivered on our commitment. Customers now come to us, and say, â€˜We have this problem, how do we solve it?'\" With data centers growing fast, Astera's revenue is expected to reach $100 million this year.",
