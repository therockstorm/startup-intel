With this idea in mind, he and Bandeali started 0x Labs, which enables developers and businesses to create new markets for their tokens on major blockchains, including Ethereum and Avalanche. The San Francisco-based firm also operates decentralized exchange (DEX) aggregator Matcha, a search engine of sorts that helps traders optimize costs by showing the best prices across a number of exchanges. Last month, Matcha handled approximately $1 billion of the total $5.2 billion in DEX aggregator trading. In April, 0x partnered with Coinbase, the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the U.S., to power Coinbase's new marketplace for NFTs.",
